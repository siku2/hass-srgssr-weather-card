# Lovelace animated weather card for SRG SSR

This is a fork of the excellent [Weather Card](https://github.com/bramkragten/weather-card).
It's designed to be used with the [SRG SSR Weather Integration](https://github.com/siku2/hass-weather-srgssr).

It uses the official icons provided by SRG SSR (Grab your own copy [here](https://developer.srgssr.ch/apis/srgssr-weather)) in order to cover the wide range of states reported by the API.
Of course this basically ruins the design of the card, but that's just how it is.
